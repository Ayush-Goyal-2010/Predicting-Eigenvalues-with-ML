# Descirption
I attempt to predict eigenvalues of upto 5x5 matrices. I use Ant Colony Optimization, K Nearest Neighbours, Random Forest, Support Vector Regression and Multi Layer Perceptron. It uses a raw model with only the matrix values and a featured mdoel with sutff like trace, symmetry score and more engineered features. It also generates data on its own using custom script.

# Demo
Just download the rep (still a work in progress)
